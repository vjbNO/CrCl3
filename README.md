Magnon Transport in a bilayer CrCl (honeycomb vdW magnet) under Strain. Excitation with Temperature and Spin Transfer Torque

In this projet, mangon transport is studied atomistically with VAMPIRE in the bilayer vdW material CrCl. Strain can modify the magnetic properties. DFT studies report parameter describing this. We use these parameters and put them in the the ucf- and material files. We pick three strain cases: negative, 0 and positive (folder labels 'MinusStrain, 'ZeroStrain', PlusStrain)

The two excitation mechanism are thermal (Spin Seebeck effect, SEE) and electrical (Spin transfer torque, STT).
